8-4 Journal: Portfolio Submission


Looking back on the project I will remember the beginning of the course imagining how I was even going to be able to complete the coursework. My advisor set me up to only take one course this term due to the difficulty that many students have and those who have tried and failed so even getting up to this point was a big deal. Going through OpenGL with Visual Code took time and effort to be accustomed with, especially with the different shapes that we were trying to create. Working with pyramids and cubes was easier to learn with the included tutorials which I quickly learned were the most crucial part of the course. I changed some of my choices leading up to my final project because I was more familiar with the creation of some shapes than others. The difficulty factor of some shapes led me to make changes to my original plan, but I was able to flow through the project and learn more that way.
